I was invited to participate in an interactive media hackathon organized by the Tribeca Film Institute. Our team of four consisted of two designers, a VR producer, an activist, and myself. We designed and prototyped a campaign around ICE Arrest at courthouses that incorporates audio testimonials of the families' of the arrested as well as a splash of VR. The goal was to increase awareness around the issue of courthouse arrests, a troubling practice in which individuals who are in various states of legal status with regard to residency are arrested at courthouses undermining justice and undercutting their ability to fight their cases, while taking an enormous emotional toll on their families and communities.

The idea was to place markers and kiosks that played their stories, as a type of mixed media social biography, around the courts where they were arrested. Another component was a set of Augmented Reality (AR) presentations that could be accessed over the web (without the use of an application) and triggered by small markers. These AR pieces would serve as fenestrations creating windows into the opaque judicial system that so often fails to serve justice.

The hackathon was pretty amazing and the whole experience allowed me to become familiar with WebAR ([demo](https://ar-demos.c13x.cloud/)). WebAR seems useful since there is no need for an additional app, the entire project works from within a phone's browser. This is an obvious next step in advancing the medium since downloading an application can present significant friction which may discourage an audience from participating.
