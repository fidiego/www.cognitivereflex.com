### What'd I Do?

- Worked with a product fellow and design fellow to identify issues faced by low
  income New Yorkers.
- Conducted one-on-one interviews and held focus groups to identify an issue
  and developed and built a product base on our insights.

### Reflections

This was an interesting experience and my introduction to civtech, design thinking, and the "product" role.
