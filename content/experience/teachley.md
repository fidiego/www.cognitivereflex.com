### What did I do?

I came in as the main backend dev fresh out of undergrad. I dove right into the deep end as a fullstack developer building out an entire platform in Django with a splash of Javascript. It was my first experience building a consumer product and for a full-blown business with real customers, nonetheless. It was an incredibly edifying experience to be charged with building, deployin, maintaining, and iterating on a product that was used in classboards every single day.

### Reflections

This was an amazing and edifying experience upon which the rest of my career was built. It was awesome to work with a group of founders who were passionate about their work and had experience in the field they aimed to serve as well as an incredibly robust, science-based design methodology.
